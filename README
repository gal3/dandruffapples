Hey guys,

so here's out Github folder. Please, make a new folder for each program being made. I'll start it off, by making a regionserver folder and (only very very lightly) creating the outline of a region server's code.

For leave any discussions on the Google Group, but otherwise make sure to leave annotations with every commit so that we know what everybody's modified and added.
